- Process of utilizing the bit representation to solve real world problems.
- ## Maximize the score after N operations
	- Given an integer array `2*n` integers we need to apply n operations.
		- Each operation
			- Chose two indicies x and y.
			- `score = gcd(nums[x],nums[y]) * (i)` where i is the operation number.
			- remove the index x and y from the array.
	- Initial thinking
		- we need to find pairs.
		- we need to think of some way to mark the already chosen.
	- We could use __bit mask__ for marking already chosen indicies.
