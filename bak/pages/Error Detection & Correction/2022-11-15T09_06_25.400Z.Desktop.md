- ### Basic of Channel and Code Word
	- Any Information Contains bits 
	  \begin{equation}
	  n =  k+r 
	  \end{equation}
	  Where n is the total number of bits 
	  k is the no of information bits 
	  r is Redundant Bits
	- Every channel has an upper limit on the rate at which information can be transmitted reliably through channel , this limitation of channel capacity to transmit information is referred as ^^CHANNEL CAPACITY^^
	- Due to noise there will be error in transmitted bits at receiver side and to correct it we use block code .
	- A block code is a set of words that has a well defined structure and where each word is a sequence of fixed no of bits .
		- Block code is used in channel encoder for error correction .
		- At Source encoder we do source decoding , where we reduce redundancy to improve bandwidth utilization .
	- **Basics of Block Code**
		- Information bits = k
		  i = [i_{1} , i_{2} , i_{3}, ... , .. , i_{k}]
		- Parity bits / Redundant Bits = r
		  p = [p_{1} , p_{2}, p_{3} , ... p_{r}]
		- Total bits of code , n = k + r 
		  n = [i_{1} , i_{2} , i_{3}, ... , .. , i_{k} , p_{1} , p_{2}, p_{3} , ... p_{r} ]
		- Block Code Representation 
		  (n,r)
		- Total code words required as per n Block codes = 2^{n}
		- Total Code words required as per k information = 2^{k}
		- Total redundant code words required as per r parity bits = 2^{n} - 2^{k}
	- ### Single Parity Check Code
		- There are a class of error detecting block codes that provides simplest form of error control , In this the codes uses a single parity bit to generate codewords with even or odd parity .
		- In ( n , k ) block codes , information bits are k 
		  i = [ i_{1} , i_{2} , i_{3} , ... i_{k}]
		- for even parity bit P = i_{1} + i_{2}+i_{3} ...... i_{k}
		- #+BEGIN_NOTE
		  Here + is modulo 2 addition
		  #+END_NOTE
		- Codeword = [ i_{1} , i_{2} , i_{3} .... i_{k} , P]
		- To determine whether received codeword is correct , we do check sum of received codeword
		  If V is the received codeword then 
		  V = [ V_{1} , V_{2} , V_{3} , .... V_{n}] 
		  S  = V_{1} + V_{2} + V_{3} + V_{4} ..... + V_{n}
			- Is S = 0 , for even parity
			- If S = 1 , for odd parity
	- ### Block Code for Product Code
		- As we know that in single parity check code have no error correction capability .
		- For even parity check just do modulo 2 addition
		- Fit we calculate the row parity , then column parity .
		- It is used to detect and correct one bit error .
		- It is only suitable for single bit error detection i.e does not work if multiple bit error is present .
	- ### Repetition Code
		- There are the codes that repeat information bits two or more times .
		- They are block codes in which the parity bits are set equal to single information bit and if the no of parity bits is 'n-1' then the code is referred to as ( n , 1 ) .
		- Parity bits are repeating information bits i.e we are repeating information bits as parity bits .
		- **Encoding Process**
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1667707444805_0.png)
		- **Decoding Process**
			- It is done by ^^Majority Vote Decoding^^ .
				- If the no of zeros is more then we say received is zero bit information .
				- If the no of one's is more than we say received is one bit information .
				- Formula for majority vote decoding for V_{1} , V_{2} , V_{3}
				  \begin{equation}
				  I =   \left(  { V  }_{ 1  }   \cdot   { V  }_{ 2  }  + { V  }_{ 1  }   \cdot   { V  }_{ 3  }  + { V  }_{ 2  }   \cdot   { V  }_{ 3 }    \right)   
				  \end{equation}
		- Not useful for multiple bit error
	- ### Linear Code
		- A block is said to be linear if its codewords satisfy the condition the sum of any two codewords gives another codeword .
			- \begin{equation}
			   { C  }_{ k  }   =   { C  }_{ 1  }  + { C  }_{ 2  }   
			  \end{equation}
			  Here Modulo 2 Addition
		- **Properties of Linear code**
			- The all zero word [ 0 , 0 , 0 , .... 0] is always a codeword .
			- Given any three codewords C_{i} ,  C_{j} , C_{k} 
			  C_{i} + C_{j} = C_{k} then D(C_{i} , C_{j}) = W(C_{k})
			  
			  #+BEGIN_NOTE
			  D => Distance between C_{i} , C_{j} , W=>Weight of Codeword C_{k} 
			  #+END_NOTE
			- Minimum Distance of the code [ d_{min} = W_{min} ]
			- #+BEGIN_IMPORTANT
			  W_{i} => no of one's in C_{i} ,
			  D_{min} => Minimum Hamming distance i.e C_{1} and C_{10} Differ at how many places .
